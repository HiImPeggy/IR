) to assess the superiority of sequential treatment ( paclitaxel then tegafur and uracil [ UFT ] or paclitaxel then S-1 ) compared with monotherapy ( UFT or S-1 ) and also the non-inferiority of UFT compared with S-1 .We did this randomised phase 3 trial with a two-by-two factorial design at 230 hospitals in Japan .We enrolled patients aged 20-80 years with T4a or T4b gastric cancer , who had had D2 dissection and a ECOG performance score of 0-1 .Patients were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups with minimisation for tumour size , lymph node metastasis , and study site .Patients received UFT only ( 267 mg/m ( 2 ) per day ) , S-1 only ( 80 mg/m ( 2 ) per day ) for 14 days , with a 7-day rest period or three courses of intermittent weekly paclitaxel ( 80 mg/m ( 2 ) ) followed by either UFT , or S-1 .Treatment lasted 48 weeks in monotherapy groups and 49 weeks in the sequential treatment groups .The primary endpoint was disease-free survival assessed by intention to treat .We assessed whether UFT was non-inferior to S-1 with a non-inferiority margin of 133 .This trial was registered at UMIN Clinical Trials Registry , number C000000082 .We randomly assigned 1495 patients between Aug 3 , 2004 , and Sept 29 , 2009.374 patients were assigned to receive UFT alone , 374 to receive S-1 alone , 374 to received paclitaxel then UFT , and 373 to receive paclitaxel then S-1 .We included 1433 patients in the primary analysis after at least 3 years of follow-up ( 359 , 364 , 355 , and 355 in each group respectively ) .Protocol treatment was completed by 215 ( 60 % ) patients in the UFT group , 224 ( 62 % ) in the S-1 group , 242 ( 68 % ) in the paclitaxel then UFT group , and 250 ( 70 % ) in the paclitaxel then S-1 group .3-year disease-free survival for monotherapy was 540 % ( 95 % CI 502-576 ) and that of sequential treatment was 572 % ( 534-608 ; hazard ratio [ HR ] 092 , 95 % CI 080-107 , p = 0273 ) .3-year disease-free survival for the UFT group was 530 % ( 95 % CI 492-566 ) and that of the S-1 group was 582 % ( 544-618 ; HR 081 , 95 % CI 070-093 , p = 00048 ; pnon-inferiority = 0151 ) .The most common grade 3-4 haematological adverse event was neutropenia ( 41 [ 11 % ] of 359 patients in the UFT group , 48 [ 13 % ] of 363 in the S-1 group , 46 [ 13 % ] of 355 in the paclitaxel then UFT group , and 83 [ 23 % ] of 356 in the paclitaxel then S-1 group ) .The most common grade 3-4 non-haematological adverse event was anorexia ( 21 [ 6 % ] , 24 [ 7 % ] , seven [ 2 % ] , and 18 [ 5 % ] , respectively ) .Sequential treatment did not improve disease-free survival , and UFT was not non-inferior to S-1 ( and S-1 was superior to UFT ) , therefore S-1 monotherapy should remain the standard treatment for locally advanced gastric cancer
